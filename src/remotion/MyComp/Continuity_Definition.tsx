      <p>This section formally defines continuity. An initial intuitive explanation describes a continuous function as one whose graph can be drawn without lifting the pencil. The three formal conditions for continuity at a point 'c' are presented visually and textually: 1) f(c) must exist, 2) the limit of f(x) as x approaches c must exist, and 3) the limit of f(x) as x approaches c must equal f(c). Various types of discontinuities are then illustrated with animated graphs: removable (hole) with a clear definition, non-removable jump discontinuities, and non-removable infinite discontinuities (vertical asymptotes).</p>
