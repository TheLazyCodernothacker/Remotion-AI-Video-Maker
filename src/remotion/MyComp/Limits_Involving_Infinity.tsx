      <h1>Limits_Involving_Infinity</h1>
      <p>This section explores limits involving infinity. It explains limits at infinity (horizontal asymptotes), showing how to determine the end behavior of a function as x approaches positive or negative infinity, particularly for rational functions by comparing degrees of numerator and denominator. Animated graphs illustrate functions approaching horizontal asymptotes. The concept of vertical asymptotes is then introduced, defining them as locations where the function's denominator is zero but its numerator is not, leading to infinite limits. Visual examples of functions approaching positive or negative infinity near a vertical asymptote are provided.</p>
