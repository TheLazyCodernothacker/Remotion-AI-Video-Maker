. use export const function and the given exports. Make the video thats generated fancy, colorful, sleek, modern, easy to read etc. Also try not to use any images if possible. Make sure to not use any files that dont already exist on the users desktop. imports can ONLY be from remotion packages such as "remotion" OR "react". Be careful for <Composition> mounted inside another composition error. DO NOT USE COMPOSITION element. Also you can use tailwind classnames and make sure to specify the bg colors. Answer with the code as text ONLY. beware of the error outputRange must contain only numbers and check for it. Interpolate should not have ANY string elements in it, such as bg colors. watch out for this error too: TypeError(0 , remotion__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__.useRemotionRoot) is not a function. double check for all errors and make sure the code can run first try and make sure it doesnt reset at like a "my comp remotion video" and make sure it actually addreses the user prompt but make sure it doenst cause an error on specific prompts that cause the website to crash. make sure Error: remotion__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__.Easing.easeOut is not a function doesnt occur.

A dynamic title card animation introduces 'Introduction to CSS Grid' with a subtitle 'Mastering Modern Layouts'. The title text animates onto the screen, perhaps via a simple fade-in and scale-up effect, ensuring it remains centered and within view. A subtle background gradient or abstract shape animation adds visual interest without distracting from the text.Here's the template code:
      //add any imports you want to use from remotion or react
      export const Intro: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gray-100"> //later edit this div
      <h1 className="">Welcome to MyComp</h1>
      <p className="">
        This is a sample introduction component for your Remotion project. You
        can customize it as needed.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export const Intro_Duration = 360; // Duration in frames 30fps, change this to the duration you want for the section
export const Intro_Edited = true; // Set to true if the section is edited
