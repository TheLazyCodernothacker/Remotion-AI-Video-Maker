      <p>The video concludes with a concise recap of the main topics covered in Unit 1: limits, methods for evaluating limits, and the concept of continuity, including the Intermediate Value Theorem. Text and simple animations reinforce the key takeaways. The importance of these foundational concepts for understanding subsequent calculus topics (like derivatives and integrals) is emphasized. A final text prompt encourages viewers to practice or explore the next unit.</p>
