The third part is a thorough but open description of that part of the video through the limitations of remotionjs. The video will not use other videos and be more text and animation based.

Make sure each section of the video doesn't end with thanks for watching unless it is the conclusion. Make sure the timings are all correct, each text being up for enough time but not too long, and showcasing every element. Make sure the information of the video is also factually accurate " +
